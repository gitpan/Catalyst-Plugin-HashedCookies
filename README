Catalyst-Plugin-HashedCookies

When HTTP cookies are used to store a user's state or identity it's
important that your application is able to distinguish legitimate
cookies from those that have been edited or created by a malicious
user.

This module allows you to determine whether a cookie presented by a
client was created in its current state by your own application.
