Catalyst-Plugin-HashedCookies
=============================

When HTTP cookies are used to store a user's state or identity it's important
that your application is able to distinguish legitimate cookies from those
that have been edited or created by a malicious user.

This module allows you to determine whether a cookie presented by a client was
created in its current state by your own application.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
